                Urban renewal in Brooklyn, New York, involves the construction and renewal of a wide range
                of parks that
                contribute to the overall revitalisation of the borough. These parks act as important green
                spaces and
                community centres, promoting social interaction, recreational activities and environmental
                sustainability.</br></br>

                Today's diverse and varied park landscape in Brooklyn is a result of its constant renewal
                and
                exploration. These parks have been built and renewed at different times due to their unique
                location,
                historical elements, functional characteristics, risks and economic factors. A series of
                projects have
                been built to help revitalise underutilised areas, provide essential green space and enhance
                community
                well-being.</br></br>

                In this website, we seek to explore the historical process, development characteristics and
                potential
                impacts of Brooklyn's 'Park Renewal'. This may provide a good reference for the future
                development of the
                area and for the application of other urban parks for their construction and optimisation.

                    In our travels, we mainly expect to interpret the following 3 questions, i.e.</br></br>
                    1 What is the process of construction and renewal of Brooklyn Parks and what are its
                    characteristics?</br></br>
                    2 What is the current development of the completed Brooklyn Park and its surroundings?</br></br>
                    3 What are the potential natural and human factors that have impacted by the construction and
                    regeneration of the park?</br></br>

                    These questions will lead us to further dissect the role and place of parks in urban regeneration.

                        You can observe that even if the same parks are in Brooklyn, there is a great difference in the
                        time
                        of their construction and the process of their renewal. There are parks that originated in the
                        1820s, while others only started to be built at the end of the last century or even this
                        century.

                <p class="paragraph2">
                    Yes, of course! In Brooklyn, most of these lands, currently used as parks, have undergone historical
                    changes to become what they are today. Some of them have had fascinating construction experiences,
                    and
                    the parks' interior amenities such as playgrounds, sports fields, botanical gardens and even beach
                    paths
                    have provided citizens with a rich experience of urban life. Others have been required to preserve
                    their
                    natural appearance, even to the extent that they have been artificially restored and planted, in
                    order
                    to protect the environment and safeguard species diversity. You may be able to find information on

                            The map of fractures in Brooklyn provides valuable insights into the distribution
                            and impact of parkland and urban infrastructure across the borough. Brooklyn, being one of
                            the five boroughs of New York City, is renowned for its diverse neighborhoods, rich cultural
                            heritage, and extensive network of parks and green spaces.</br>
                            The borough boasts a plethora of parks and green areas that serve as valuable resources for
                            both residents and visitors. One prominent example is Prospect Park, spanning an impressive
                            526 acres. This expansive park offers a variety of amenities, including a picturesque lake,
                            a zoo, playgrounds, sports fields, and scenic trails for recreational activities. Other
                            notable parks such as McCarren Park, Brooklyn Bridge Park, Marine Park, and Fort Greene Park
                            also contribute to the borough's green infrastructure.</br>
                            Brooklyn benefits from a well-developed urban infrastructure, which supports its vibrant and
                            livable environment. The transportation network within the borough is robust, with multiple
                            subway lines of the New York City Subway system connecting various neighborhoods. This
                            extensive subway network facilitates convenient travel within Brooklyn as well as
                            connections to other parts of the city. Additionally, several bridges, notably the
                            Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge and the Williamsburg Bridge, further enhance connectivity by
                            linking Brooklyn to adjacent areas.</br>
                            The map depicting fractures in Brooklyn illustrates the widespread presence of parkland and
                            urban infrastructure throughout the borough. These resources play a vital role in enhancing
                            Brooklyn's appeal and quality of life. The parks and green spaces offer opportunities for
                            relaxation, recreation, and communing with nature, fostering a sense of well-being among
                            residents. Furthermore, these parks serve as hubs for cultural events, festivals, and
                            community gatherings, contributing to the borough's vibrant atmosphere.</br>
                            Brooklyn's robust urban infrastructure, including its transportation network and bridges,
                            facilitates efficient mobility for its residents. The easy accessibility to different
                            neighborhoods and the connectivity to
                            neighboring areas ensure seamless travel options for both commuting and exploration.</br>
                            Collectively, the parkland and urban infrastructure in Brooklyn contribute to the borough's
                            desirability as a place to live, work, and visit. They provide a wide array of recreational,
                            cultural, and economic opportunities, enhancing the overall quality of life for residents
                            and creating an attractive destination for visitors. The presence of well-maintained parks,
                            along with a comprehensive urban infrastructure, reflects the commitment to creating a
                            sustainable and thriving borough that prioritizes the well-being and satisfaction of its
                            residents.</br>

                    The pie chart titled "Accessible Facilities in Brooklyn's Parks" provides a visual
                    representation of the distribution of different types of facilities available in the parks of
                    Brooklyn. The chart illustrates the proportion of each facility type, highlighting the emphasis
                    placed on creating accessible spaces for all individuals to enjoy.</br>
                    According to the chart, playgrounds comprise the largest portion, accounting for 70% of the
                    facilities. Playgrounds in Brooklyn's parks are designed to accommodate children of all abilities,
                    featuring ramps, transfer platforms, and wider pathways that ensure easy access and enjoyment of the
                    play structures for children with disabilities.</br>
                    Bathrooms make up 10% of the facilities, indicating the efforts made to provide accessible restroom
                    options. These bathrooms are equipped with features such as grab bars, lower sinks, and larger
                    stalls to accommodate individuals with mobility challenges, promoting inclusivity within the park
                    environment.</br>
                    Pools represent 5% of the facilities, and special attention has been given to make them accessible.
                    These pools often offer entry options such as pool lifts, zero-depth entry, or sloped ramps,
                    allowing individuals with disabilities to enter the water safely and participate in aquatic
                    activities.</br>
                    Recreation centers account for 4% of the facilities, offering a range of inclusive programming and
                    accessible amenities. These centers may include fitness rooms, sports courts, and modified equipment
                    to ensure individuals with disabilities can actively engage in recreational activities. Ramps,
                    elevators, and other modifications are implemented to create an inclusive environment for all
                    visitors.</br>
                    Tennis courts and basketball courts each make up 4% of the facilities, providing accessible spaces
                    for sports enthusiasts. These courts may incorporate features such as wheelchair-accessible entry
                    points or modified court surfaces to accommodate individuals with disabilities.
                    Beaches and nature centers both represent 1% of the facilities. Efforts are made to provide
                    accessibility options in Brooklyn's beaches, such as beach mats for wheelchair access, accessible
                    beach wheelchairs, and nearby accessible restroom facilities. Nature centers also aim to create
                    inclusive environments, offering accessible trails, exhibits, and programs for individuals with
                    disabilities.</br>
                    The distribution of accessible facilities in Brooklyn's parks demonstrates a commitment to ensuring
                    equal access and enjoyment for all individuals. By providing a variety of inclusive amenities, the
                    parks contribute to creating an environment that fosters inclusivity, promotes physical activity,
                    and enriches the overall park experience.</br>
                    The focus on accessibility not only benefits park visitors but also has broader economic
                    implications. Proximity to well-maintained parks in Brooklyn has been shown to positively impact
                    property values in the surrounding areas. Increased demand and higher property prices contribute to
                    the local economy by boosting the real estate market and generating property tax revenues.
                    Furthermore, the presence of concession stands, food vendors, and recreational equipment rentals
                    within the parks adds to the economic vibrancy of the community. These businesses provide services
                    and generate revenue through sales and rentals, creating entrepreneurial opportunities and
                    supporting local vendors and suppliers.</br>
                    Brooklyn's parks also serve as venues for cultural festivals, concerts, and other entertainment
                    events. These events attract visitors, driving economic activity in terms of ticket sales, food and
                    beverage sales, merchandise, and associated services. They not only contribute to the local economy
                    but also promote the local arts and culture scene, foster community engagement, and support local
                    artists and performers.</br>
                    In summary, the pie chart reveals the significant emphasis placed on accessibility in Brooklyn's
                    parks, with a wide range of facilities designed to accommodate individuals of all abilities. This
                    commitment to inclusivity not only enhances the park experience for visitors but also
                    contributes to the economic vitality of the surrounding areas.</br>

                        The line charts titled "Revenue and Expense of Brooklyn Park from 2016 to 2022"
                        provide a visual representation of the financial trends of Brooklyn's park system over the
                        specified time period. The revenue chart illustrates the sources of income, including
                        contributions and grants, government support, program service revenue, and events, while the
                        expense chart showcases the allocation of funds into program services, management and general,
                        and fundraising.</br>
                        Examining the revenue chart, it is evident that the total revenue shows a gradual increase from
                        2016 to 2020. However, in 2021, there is a significant drop to 60% of the previous year's
                        revenue, followed by a substantial increase and peak in 2022. Contributions and events are the
                        two largest sources of revenue throughout the entire period, with contributions remaining
                        relatively consistent over time. In contrast, all other revenue sources experience a decline in
                        2021, reaching their lowest levels. Notably, despite the fluctuations, the total revenue
                        ultimately demonstrates growth over the years.</br>
                        The expense chart reveals that the total expense of Brooklyn Park is roughly equivalent to the
                        total revenue. The expenses are divided into three categories: program services, management and
                        general, and fundraising. Program services consistently represent approximately 80% of the total
                        expense and follow a similar trend to the overall expenditure. On the other hand, management and
                        general, as well as fundraising, exhibit relatively minor changes over the analyzed period.
                        Considering the impact of Brooklyn's parks on the local economy, it is evident that they attract
                        a substantial number of tourists and visitors. These individuals engage in various recreational
                        activities, cultural events, and sightseeing, leading to expenditures on accommodations, dining,
                        shopping, transportation, and related services. This influx of visitors significantly benefits
                        local businesses. Moreover, the presence of parks creates employment opportunities, both
                        directly and indirectly. The parks require staff for maintenance, operations, programming, and
                        administration.</br>
                        Additionally, the park system generates employment in sectors such as hospitality, tourism,
                        retail, and event management, thereby stimulating the local job market.</br>
                        Furthermore, parks serve as venues for recreational activities, sports events, and fitness
                        programs, contributing to the local economy by supporting businesses such as sports equipment
                        retailers, fitness studios, trainers, and event organizers. Moreover, individuals participating
                        in sports leagues and tournaments held within Brooklyn's parks generate additional economic
                        activity.</br>
                        In summary, the line charts illustrate the revenue and expense trends of Brooklyn's park system
                        from 2016 to 2022. The revenue chart demonstrates the sources of income, with contributions and
                        events being the primary revenue drivers. The total expense aligns closely with the total
                        revenue, with program services representing the largest portion. Brooklyn's parks play a
                        significant role in the local economy by attracting tourists, creating employment opportunities,
                        and supporting various businesses through recreational activities and events.</br>

                    In 2021, Brooklyn Park's financial situation is depicted through two pie charts,
                    highlighting the revenue and expense components. These charts provide an overview of the sources of
                    revenue and the allocation of funds for expenses during that specific year.</br>
                    The revenue pie chart for 2021 reveals the following breakdown: contributions and grants account for
                    32.5% of the total revenue, government support represents 28.4%, program service revenue contributes
                    26.9%, and events generate 12% of the revenue.</br>
                    Among the revenue sources, contributions and grants hold the largest proportion, followed closely by
                    government support and program service revenue. Events make up a smaller portion but still
                    contribute significantly to the overall revenue stream. These figures reflect the diverse funding
                    sources that support Brooklyn Park's operations and programs throughout the year.</br>
                    Turning to the expense pie chart for 2021, the allocation of funds is divided as follows: program
                    services account for 72.1% of the total expense, fundraising represents 20.1%, and management and
                    general expenses make up 7.8%.</br>
                    The largest portion of the expense goes toward program services, which aligns with the park's core
                    mission of providing recreational activities, maintaining park facilities, and organizing various
                    programs for the community. Fundraising expenses represent a significant but smaller portion, which
                    includes activities aimed at generating additional revenue and support for the park. Lastly,
                    management and general expenses occupy the smallest portion, covering administrative and operational
                    costs.</br>
                    Considering the impact of Brooklyn's parks on the local economy, their proximity has been shown to
                    positively influence property values in the surrounding areas. Homes and commercial properties
                    situated near well-maintained parks experience increased demand and higher property prices. This
                    phenomenon contributes to the local economy by boosting the real estate market and generating
                    property tax revenues.</br>
                    Furthermore, the presence of concession stands, food vendors, and recreational equipment rentals
                    within many parks in
                    Brooklyn contributes to the local economy. These businesses provide services to park visitors and
                    generate revenue through sales and rentals. Additionally, they create entrepreneurial opportunities
                    and support local vendors and suppliers, further enhancing the economic ecosystem.</br>
                    Brooklyn's parks often serve as hosts for cultural festivals, concerts, and other entertainment
                    events. These gatherings attract visitors from both near and far, leading to economic activity
                    through ticket sales, food and beverage purchases, merchandise sales, and associated services.
                    Additionally, these events promote the local arts and culture scene, foster community engagement,
                    and provide support to local artists and performers.</br>
                    In summary, the revenue and expense pie charts for 2021 showcase the various sources of revenue and
                    the allocation of funds within Brooklyn Park. The revenue sources encompass contributions,
                    government support, program service revenue, and events. Meanwhile, the expense components consist
                    of program services, fundraising, and management and general expenses. The proximity of parks in
                    Brooklyn positively impacts property values and contributes to the local economy through real estate
                    market growth, property tax revenues, concession stands, cultural events, and the support of local
                    businesses and artists.</br>

                                The interactive map of urban green in Brooklyn showcases the distribution of street
                                trees in 1995, 2005, and 2015. The map utilizes a hexagonal layer that is color-coded
                                based on the number of trees within each hexagon. Additionally, there is a layer
                                indicating the presence of parks overlaid on the map. </br>
                                Over the examined period, the number of street trees in Brooklyn has increased, with the
                                highest count observed in 2015. Furthermore, the distribution of trees in 2015 appears
                                to be more evenly spread throughout the borough compared to 1995 and 2005. In the
                                earlier years, regions in the northern part of Brooklyn tended to have slightly more
                                street trees.</br>
                                During this period, tree planting initiatives were implemented to augment the urban tree
                                canopy in Brooklyn. The planting of new trees brings about various positive impacts.
                                Firstly, it helps improve air quality by absorbing pollutants and releasing oxygen.</br>
                                Secondly, street trees provide shade, offering relief from the sun's heat and
                                contributing to the reduction of the urban heat island effect. Moreover, an enhanced
                                tree canopy adds to the aesthetic appeal of the neighborhood, creating a more visually
                                pleasing and welcoming environment.</br>
                                It is noteworthy that planting a diverse range of tree species is essential. This
                                practice enhances resilience to diseases, pests, and the effects of climate change.
                                Furthermore, it promotes biodiversity and fosters a more vibrant and ecologically
                                balanced urban ecosystem.</br>
                                During this time, there has been an increase in community engagement in street tree
                                initiatives. Encouraging community involvement in tree planting, care, and advocacy
                                yields several benefits. It cultivates a sense of ownership and pride among residents,
                                raises environmental awareness, and strengthens social connections within the
                                neighborhood.</br>
                                Street tree planting also plays a crucial role in mitigating the urban heat island
                                effect. This phenomenon refers to the higher temperatures experienced in urban areas
                                compared to the surrounding rural areas.By providing shade and evaporative cooling,
                                street trees help reduce surface and air temperatures, making the neighborhood more
                                comfortable and energy-efficient.</br>
                                Overall, the interactive map of urban green in Brooklyn demonstrates the changing
                                distribution of street trees over time and highlights the positive impacts of tree
                                planting initiatives, such as improved air quality, temperature reduction, and community
                                engagement.</br>

                            <p class="paragraph1">
                                By examining data sourced from NYC Open Data and conducting a comprehensive analysis,
                                we gained valuable insights into the levels of pollutants, specifically PM2.5 and
                                nitrogen
                                dioxide, from 2009 to 2020 in Brooklyn. The findings indicated a consistent and
                                significant
                                decrease in the concentrations of these pollutants throughout the entire region during
                                this
                                period.</br>
                                The data allowed us to identify a spatial pattern in the distribution of air pollutants.
                                Generally, areas with high population densities, characterized by heavy vehicular
                                traffic
                                and industrial activities, exhibited higher pollution levels. This is attributed to the
                                emissions produced by vehicles and the industrial processes in those areas. However, the
                                presence of parks in Brooklyn played a crucial role in alleviating air pollution.</br>
                                Parks functioned as natural filters that effectively captured and absorbed pollutants,
                                leading to an improvement in local air quality. These green spaces acted as carbon
                                sinks,
                                using photosynthesis to absorb carbon dioxide (a precursor to PM2.5) and other harmful
                                substances from the atmosphere. Additionally, the vegetation and trees within the parks
                                acted as physical barriers, effectively blocking or dispersing pollutants like nitrogen
                                dioxide emitted from nearby pollution sources.</br>
                                The combined influence of these factors resulted in lower levels of PM2.5 and nitrogen
                                dioxide in neighborhoods with a higher density of parks compared to areas lacking such
                                green
                                spaces. Over time, as the trees and vegetation in parks grew in size and density, their
                                capacity to absorb pollutants increased, contributing to a gradual reduction in air
                                pollution levels.</br>
                                It is important to note that while parks significantly contribute to improving air
                                quality,
                                the overall decline in PM2.5 and nitrogen dioxide levels in Brooklyn from 2009 to 2020
                                can
                                be attributed to broader environmental factors such as stricter regulations,
                                technological
                                advancements, and changes in energy sources.</br>

                                Between 1970 and 2010, the population dynamics in Brooklyn, NYC, underwent
                                significant
                                transformations across its diverse neighborhoods. Initially, many areas
                                experienced
                                a
                                decline in population due to economic challenges and suburbanization, resulting
                                in
                                neglected
                                parks. However, starting in the 1990s, certain neighborhoods began to experience
                                population
                                growth and gentrification, leading to renewed interest in parks and their impact
                                on
                                specific
                                communities.</br>
                                One notable example is Prospect Park in the neighborhoods of Park Slope and
                                Prospect
                                Heights. As population growth surged in the 1990s and early 2000s, Prospect Park
                                underwent
                                extensive revitalization efforts. The park's infrastructure was upgraded,
                                walking
                                and biking
                                trails were improved, and new amenities such as sports fields and playgrounds
                                were
                                added.</br>
                                These enhancements made Prospect Park a popular destination for both residents
                                and
                                visitors,
                                attracting families, joggers, and nature enthusiasts. The park's renewal played
                                a
                                significant role in the revitalization of Park Slope and Prospect Heights,
                                contributing to
                                increased property values and a sense of community cohesion.</br>
                                In DUMBO (Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass), the Brooklyn Bridge Park
                                stands
                                as a
                                prime example of how park renewal can drive neighborhood transformation.
                                Formerly an
                                industrial waterfront area, DUMBO experienced a rapid population increase as
                                artists,
                                entrepreneurs, and professionals were drawn to its unique charm. The creation of
                                Brooklyn
                                Bridge Park, with its lush green spaces, waterfront promenade, and recreational
                                amenities,
                                became a catalyst for further development and investment in DUMBO. The park's
                                scenic
                                views
                                and vibrant programming attracted visitors and residents alike, fostering a
                                thriving
                                community and supporting the area's economic growth.</br>

                                From 2000 to 2022, the house prices in different areas of Brooklyn, NYC,
                                experienced significant changes,
                                influenced by various factors including population growth, neighborhood
                                transformations, and the renewal of
                                parks. Overall, Brooklyn witnessed a substantial increase in property values
                                during this period.<br>
                                One example of a neighborhood that saw a remarkable surge in house prices is
                                Williamsburg. In the early 2000s,
                                Williamsburg underwent a rapid transformation from an industrial area to a
                                vibrant cultural hub, attracting
                                artists, young professionals, and entrepreneurs. The renewal of McCarren Park
                                played a role in this
                                transformation, as the park became a focal point for community activities and
                                events. The increased
                                desirability of Williamsburg, coupled with the park's amenities, contributed to
                                a surge in house prices,
                                making it one of the most sought-after neighborhoods in Brooklyn.<br>
