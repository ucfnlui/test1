                            Belt and Shore Parkway is located in the south-west of Brooklyn. The Shore Parkway, Southern
                            Parkway, Laurelton Parkway, and Cross Island Parkway are collectively known as the "Belt
                            System".
                            The Belt Parkway was one of many parkways in the New York metropolitan area built by Robert
                            Moses.
                            Moses considered Shore Parkway, and the rest of the Belt Parkway, to be a “continuous park
                            system,
                            not merely an automobile artery, a system of shoestring parks and recreational facilities
                            encircling
                            the entire metropolis….”. </br></br>

                        Dyker Beach Park is located in the West of Brooklyn, assembled from eight pieces of land over
                        the
                        course of forty years. Dyker Beach Park has developed into a lively park that serves the varied
                        needs of its diverse community. The facilities in the park make it the only golf course in the
                        city
                        dedicated to serving and teaching young golfers. </br></br>

                        Company for a park. The landscape architecture firm of Olmsted, Olmsted & Eliot planned a

                        saltwater lagoon, children's playgrounds, bathhouses, lawns, and drives along the shore.</br>
                        1911 - Some of the plans were revised by Charles D. Lay, former landscape architect of the Park
                        Board. He proposed to decrease the size of the lagoon to 16 acres and add several concert
                        groves.</br>
                        1918 – The work began to fill a swampy area of the park.</br>
                        1924-27 - Four additional parcels were acquired by assignment and condemnation.</br>
                        Dyker Beach Park is located in the West of Brooklyn, assembled from eight pieces of land over

                        Highland Park is situated on a high plateau in the Northeast of Brooklyn, straddling Brooklyn
                        and
                        Queens. The park commands dramatic views of nearby cemeteries, East New York, Woodhaven, the
                        Rockaways, and the Atlantic Ocean. </br></br>

                        1856 - The City of Brooklyn acquired land here for the site of the Ridgewood Reservoir, which
                        operated from the 1860s until 1985.</br>

                        known as Ridgewood Park. Several new structures were built. Landscaping efforts laid out roads
                        and
                        footpaths, created a new lake with a fountain, and reclaimed a swamp for the site of a flower

                        three land acquisitions. It offers water views and glimpses of the winged wildlife naturally

                        synthetic
                        turf fields, some sports courts and a newly restored waterfront.</br></br>

                        the

                        aquatic
                        and coastal habitats, a main entry rain garden, and the field house. </br></br>

                        Manhattan Beach Park is located in the South of Brooklyn, and is a popular summertime
                        destination for people from all over New York City.</br>
                        In 1866, Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux conceived of a network of wide, tree-lined
                        avenues that would cut across the grid of Brooklyn and link its open spaces. Modeled after the
                        Avenue de L’Impératrice (now the Avenue Foch) in Paris, Olmsted and Vaux’s new roads differed
                        from their French predecessors in that they stretched for several miles. They were intended to
                        provide sumptuous green corridors along which citizens could live and take pleasure drives. Two
                        of them were built along Olmsted and Vaux’s newly designed Prospect Park: Eastern Parkway,
                        running from Prospect Park to Crown Heights, and Ocean Parkway, connecting Prospect Park to
                        Coney Island. </br></br>

                        1877 - Manhattan Beach was created by real estate developer Austin Corbin as a self-contained
                        summer resort on 500 acres of salt marsh.</br>
                        1907 - Residential development began</br>
                        1942 - The land on this site was originally acquired by the Federal Government.</br>
                        1955 - An additional 24.4 acres were acquired</br>
                        1997 - It was renovated under a $778,000 capital project funded by Borough President Golden and
                        Councilmember Anthony D. Weiner. </br></br>
